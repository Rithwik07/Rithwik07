## üëã About Me

I'm a product-minded Full-Stack Engineer with a strong focus on **backend development, scalable cloud infrastructure, and API-first solutions**. My expertise lies in building highly available, data-informed platforms using modern technologies like **Node.js (TypeScript), Go, and React**.

I thrive in lean, collaborative environments where engineers have end-to-end ownership‚Äîfrom architectural design to production support. Passionate about solving complex problems with elegant code, I'm always eager to ship fast, learn continuously, and contribute to impactful projects.

Currently pursuing an **MSc in Computing (2:1 Expected) at the University of East London**.

## üöÄ Key Projects & Contributions

Here are some highlights of my recent work, showcasing my skills in full-stack development, cloud, and emerging technologies:

* **Multi-tenant Doctor-Patient Platform (MERN Stack)**:
    * Designed and built a secure, role-based platform with dynamic routing and session security.
    * Implemented RESTful APIs on AWS Lambda with PostgreSQL for robust data management.
    * Integrated data analytics dashboards (Chart.js) and internal metrics, leading a 5-member agile team.
    * Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Docker.

* **Backend API Microservices (Node.js, Go, PostgreSQL)**:
    * Engineered and deployed REST API microservices for internal tools (voting, tax calculators, DeFi portfolios).
    * Developed an event-driven architecture for a decentralized voting platform with Kafka-style queue simulation and fault tolerance.
    * Implemented Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) for GCP/Azure provisioning via GitHub Actions.
    * Configured Kubernetes CRDs and ArgoCD workflows for blue/green deployments, focusing on API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).

* **TechForce.ai Contribution (Frontend UI)**:
    * Contributed to a cloud-focused IT support project, building the frontend UI with Framer and React, optimized branding, and deployed on Azure.
    * Improved bug response time by 35% through Datadog error monitoring and log-based alerts.

* **AI DeFi Portfolio Optimizer (Python & React)** - *Polkadot Hackathon Project*
    * Integrated an ML model to optimize DeFi investments based on user-defined risk scores.

* **Real-time Sign Language Translator (OpenCV, CNN & BiLSTM)**
    * Developed British Sign Language (BSL) recognition system, focusing on gesture preprocessing and multi-class classification.

* **Blockchain Voting App (Polkadot & ink!)**
    * Created a decentralized voting system emphasizing cryptographic integrity and gas optimization using Polkadot and smart contracts.
